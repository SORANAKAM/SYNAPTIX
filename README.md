## 🚨 The Problem

Students face a brutal reality during exam season:
- **Time scarcity** — too much syllabus, too little time
- **Cognitive overload** — trying to learn everything leads to learning nothing
- **Stress paralysis** — anxiety blocks productivity
- **Generic schedules** — one-size-fits-all plans that ignore human inconsistency

---

## 💡 The Solution

**Academic Rescue Agent** is an AI-powered intervention system that doesn't just create schedules — it *strategically rescues* your exam preparation by:

| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| 🎯 **Priority Triage** | Identifies high-yield topics to maximize marks per hour |
| ✂️ **Strategic Skipping** | Tells you what to *not* study (and why) |
| 🧠 **Cognitive Load Balancing** | Alternates difficulty to prevent burnout |
| 📊 **Stress-Adaptive Planning** | Reduces workload when stress is high |
| 🔄 **Daily Adaptation** | Re-optimizes based on your actual progress |

---

## ✨ Features

### 📝 Smart Onboarding
- Input your exam date, subjects, and syllabus
- Rate your confidence level per subject (1-5)
- Specify available daily study hours
- Indicate current stress level

### 📅 Intelligent Schedule Generation
- Day-by-day task breakdown with effort ratings
- Strategic mix of study, review, practice, and breaks
- Daily checkpoints and stress management tips
- Pacing philosophy tailored to your situation

### 🔄 Adaptive Re-Planning
- Check in daily with completed tasks
- Report stress level changes
- AI regenerates the plan based on:
  - Missed tasks (dropped or condensed, not just pushed)
  - Stress increases (reduced difficulty for next 2 days)
  - Actual progress vs. expected progress

### 📊 Visual Dashboard
- Progress tracking with interactive charts
- Task completion interface
- Strategy overview panel
- Stress tips and motivation boosters

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- [Gemini API Key](https://ai.google.dev/)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/academic-rescue-agent.git
cd academic-rescue-agent

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
# Edit .env.local and add your Gemini API key
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### AI Reasoning Framework

The Gemini AI follows a specialized reasoning framework:

1. **Time Scarcity Analysis** — Calculates remaining days, identifies impossible coverage zones
2. **Cognitive Load Management** — Avoids consecutive high-effort tasks, inserts recovery
3. **Weakness-Priority Logic** — Focuses on low-confidence + high-impact topics
4. **Stress-Adaptive Planning** — High stress = reduced volume automatically
5. **Human Behavior Assumptions** — Accounts for procrastination and anxiety
